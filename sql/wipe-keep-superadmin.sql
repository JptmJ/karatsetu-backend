-- =====================================================================
-- Swarnay / Swarnay - wipe all data BUT keep the super-admin login
--
-- Identical to wipe-all-data.sql except that `platform_user` is left alone,
-- so you can still sign in to the super-admin app afterwards. Everything
-- else goes, including every tenant, user, master and transaction.
--
-- platform_user only ever references itself, so CASCADE on the other tables
-- cannot reach it. platform_refresh_token IS cleared, so every existing
-- session is logged out and you sign in fresh.
--
-- If you would rather wipe it too: use wipe-all-data.sql, then
--   npm run seed:superadmin -- --password='...'
--
-- THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE.
