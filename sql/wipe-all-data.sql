-- =====================================================================
-- Swarnay / Swarnay - wipe ALL data from ALL tables
--
-- Schema : app            (DATABASE_SCHEMA=app in karatsetu-backend/.env)
-- Target : Supabase Postgres
-- Effect : deletes every row in all 86 application tables.
--          The schema itself (tables, columns, indexes, FKs, RLS policies)
--          is left intact, so the app boots normally afterwards.
--
-- Run it in the Supabase SQL editor, or:
--   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f sql/wipe-all-data.sql
--
-- Why TRUNCATE and not DELETE:
--   Every tenant-scoped table has RLS "enable" AND "force", so a plain
--   DELETE only sees the rows of the tenant set on the connection - that
--   applies to the table owner too. TRUNCATE is not subject to RLS at all,
--   so it clears everything in one pass. Run as the owner of the app schema
--   (the postgres role in the Supabase editor, or ratnagrid_app).
--
-- All primary keys are uuid, so there are no sequences to reset.
-- THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE. Take a Supabase backup first if unsure.
